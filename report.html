        <!-- Abstract -->
        <p>This report describes the submission of Luke Mitchell and Josh Hargreaves for the first assignment of the Web Technologies unit. Our submission is a web application that allows a user to create an online wallet that enables them to send and receive MaxCoin, a Bitcoin-like cryptocurrency that we developed earlier this year.</p>
        <p>Firstly, what is MaxCoin? MaxCoin is a cryptographic currency based upon the Bitcoin model. We created the currency to experiment with using algorithms with increased security that will enable us to utilise some very new technology, courtesy of Nigel Smart, and also to see what the effect of a media personality would have on the price of an altcoin. The coin was launched on the Keiser Report, a programme presented by Max Keiser, a proponent and namesake of the coin.</p>
        <p>This submission shows the framework and the front end of the web application. We have tried to include sample data to give a realistic impression of what the final experience will be like, when using the website.</p>

        <!-- Introduction -->
        <div>
          <h3><a id="introduction" class="anchor">Introduction</a></h3>
          <p>The application we have developed is called maxwallet. As explained in the abstract, the aim of maxwallet is to allow users to create a "web wallet", an online interface that allows them to access their MaxCoin and to send it to other users or merchants. The advantage of using a web wallet is threefold: users don't have to download a piece of software which, additionally, downloads the blockchain - the public ledger of all the transactions within MaxCoin; users can access their wallet from anywhere, worldwide, with an Internet connection; and, finally, it allows additional functionality to be included, such as the Standing Orders present within maxwallet, a feature that the desktop client doesn't have.</p>
          <p>Currently only a small handful of cryptocurrencies have web wallet services and it will be a great boon to MaxCoin once the service is launched. Additionally, we have taken great care to ensure the codebase is written in a modular manner so that it can be ported with ease to other currencies. Due to the financial nature of the web application, we have been vigilant to ensure that our code is as secure and well written as possible. If the service was to be hacked it would immediately lose it's credibility and become a detriment to the currency.</p>
          <p>Existing services for storing and handling cryptocurrency online include <a target="_blank" href="http://www.blockchain.info/">blockchain.info</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://secure.dogechain.info/wallet">dogechain.info</a>; these services typically allow a user to send and receive currency. With maxwallet, we will build upon this functionality by including the option to create regular payments to an address and to submit payment requests, much like a regular bank. We will also fully integrate with the upcoming MaxCoin Android wallet by allowing a user to interface with the web application using QR codes that we will both generate and read, using the client's camera.</p>

        <!-- Key Features -->
        <div>
          <h3><a id="keyfeatures" class="anchor">Key Features</a></h3>
          <p>web app with wallet, transaction history and details, address book, recurring payments, log in system (not yet implemented), support tickets and knowledgebase, QR generator and reader, modal windows and toasts</p>

          <!-- Angular JS -->
          <h4><a id="angularjs" class="anchor">Angular JS</a></h4>
          <p>Rewrote directives for valid XHTML, powerful technology</p>

          <!-- Responsive Design -->
          <h4><a id="responsivedesign" class="anchor">Responsive Design</a></h4>
          <p>The website we have created is fully responsive, working from all sizes of device from a widescreen, full HD screen (and larger) to a small mobile phone. The style sheets employed describe the widths as either percentages, for wrapping elements and containers, or ems, for anything related to text. Due to the use of a "sticky footer" and a "floating header", we have used pixel values in these areas; we have, however, used the <code>@media</code> CSS attributes to allow these to scale with the screen size.</p>
          <p>Certain components display completely differently when presented at different screen resolutions. One example of this is the navigation bar in the page header: this is normally a horizontal bar containing navigation items but, at screen resolutions below 768px, this is displayed as a single menu icon. When the menu icon is clicked it toggles a drop down menu containing the navigation links, conserving space on mobile devices. Another example is the tables within the Wallet section of the website: this section features a number of wallets containing information on transactions and addresses, each of which are stored in a tabular format. The tables are styled such that when they begin to overflow the surrounding element they contract and display a horizontal scroll bar instead.</p>
          <p>Below are some images showing the website being displayed at multiple resolutions.</p>

          <!-- images at different resolutions -->
          <div class="row">
            <div class="col-sm-4 report-image">
              <a href="images/report/keyfeatures/1.png"><img class="report-image" src="images/report/keyfeatures/1.png" alt="The default style of the website on a widescreen browser"></img></a>
            </div>

            <div class="col-sm-4 report-image">
              <a href="images/report/keyfeatures/2.png"><img class="report-image" src="images/report/keyfeatures/2.png" alt="The table element with a scroll bar, shown on a resized browser"></img></a>
            </div>

            <div class="col-sm-4 report-image">
              <a href="images/report/keyfeatures/3.png"><img class="report-image" src="images/report/keyfeatures/3.png" alt="The menu button shown on a mobile device"></img></a>
            </div>
          </div>
          <p><span class="text-muted">Hover over the images for a description. You can click on the images for a higher resolution.</span></p>
          <!-- end images -->

          <p>On the home page of the website there is a "carousel", a series of 3 images than are animated and will cycle between themselves, each displaying a different message on a floating <code>div</code> element. The images displayed by the carousel are resized for a variety of common screen dimensions, from VGA to Full HD. These tailor the dimensions of the displayed image and also the source image to display; when a lower resolution is required a smaller image is served, reducing the amount of data required and saving the bandwidth of mobile users. The styling for this can be found in content.css.</p>

          <p><em>Carousel, Browser shots, works on all major browsers, modernizr.js feature detection, youtube video maintains aspect ratio, works on mobiles (screenshot)</em></p>
