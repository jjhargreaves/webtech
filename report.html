        <h3><a id="abstract" class="anchor">Abstract</a></h3>
        <p>This report describes the submission of Luke Mitchell and Josh Hargreaves for the first assignment of the Web Technologies unit. Our submission is a web application that allows a user to create an online wallet that enables them to send and receive MaxCoin, a Bitcoin-like cryptocurrency that we developed earlier this year.</p>
        <p>Firstly, what is MaxCoin? MaxCoin is a cryptographic currency based upon the Bitcoin model. We created the currency to experiment with using algorithms with increased security that will enable us to utilise some very new technology, courtesy of Nigel Smart, and also to see what the effect of a media personality would have on the price of an altcoin. The coin was launched on the Keiser Report, a programme presented by Max Keiser, a proponent and namesake of the coin.</p>
        <p>This submission shows the framework and the front end of the web application. We have tried to include sample data to give a realistic impression of what the final experience will be like, when using the website.</p>

        <!-- Introduction -->
        <div>
          <h3><a id="introduction" class="anchor">Introduction</a></h3>
          <p>The application we have developed is called maxwallet. As explained in the abstract, the aim of maxwallet is to allow users to create a "web wallet", an online interface that allows them to access their MaxCoin and to send it to other users or merchants. The advantage of using a web wallet is threefold: users don't have to download a piece of software which, additionally, downloads the blockchain - the public ledger of all the transactions within MaxCoin; users can access their wallet from anywhere, worldwide, with an Internet connection; and, finally, it allows additional functionality to be included, such as the Standing Orders present within maxwallet, a feature that the desktop client doesn't have.</p>
          <p>Currently only a small handful of cryptocurrencies have web wallet services and it will be a great boon to MaxCoin once the service is launched. Additionally, we have taken great care to ensure the codebase is written in a modular manner so that it can be ported with ease to other currencies. Due to the financial nature of the web application, we have been vigilant to ensure that our code is as secure and well written as possible. If the service was to be hacked it would immediately lose it's credibility and become a detriment to the currency.</p>
          <p>Existing services for storing and handling cryptocurrency online include <a target="_blank" href="http://www.blockchain.info/">blockchain.info</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://secure.dogechain.info/wallet">dogechain.info</a>; these services typically allow a user to send and receive currency. With maxwallet, we will build upon this functionality by including the option to create regular payments to an address and to submit payment requests, much like a regular bank. We will also fully integrate with the upcoming MaxCoin Android wallet by allowing a user to interface with the web application using QR codes that we will both generate and read, using the client's camera.</p>

          <!-- Responsive Design -->
          <h4><a id="responsivedesign" class="anchor">Responsive Design</a></h4>
          <p>The website we have created is fully responsive, working from all sizes of device from a widescreen, full HD screen (and larger) to a small mobile phone. The style sheets employed describe the widths as either percentages, for wrapping elements and containers, or ems, for anything related to text. Due to the use of a "sticky footer" and a "floating header", we have used pixel values in these areas; we have, however, used the <code>@media</code> CSS attributes to allow these to scale with the screen size.</p>
          <p>Certain components display completely differently when presented at different screen resolutions. One example of this is the navigation bar in the page header: this is normally a horizontal bar containing navigation items but, at screen resolutions below 768px, this is displayed as a single menu icon. When the menu icon is clicked it toggles a drop down menu containing the navigation links, conserving space on mobile devices. Another example is the tables within the Wallet section of the website: this section features a number of wallets containing information on transactions and addresses, each of which are stored in a tabular format. The tables are styled such that when they begin to overflow the surrounding element they contract and display a horizontal scroll bar instead.</p>
          <p>Below are some images showing the website being displayed at multiple resolutions.</p>

          <div class="spacer" />

          <!-- images at different resolutions -->
          <div class="row">

          <!-- end images -->

          <p>On the home page of the website there is a "carousel", a series of 3 images than are animated and will cycle between themselves, each displaying a different message on a floating <code>div</code> element. The images displayed by the carousel are resized for a variety of common screen dimensions, from VGA to Full HD. These tailor the dimensions of the displayed image and also the source image to display; when a lower resolution is required a smaller image is served, reducing the amount of data required and saving the bandwidth of mobile users. There are 4 images of varying resolutions for this purpose. The styling for this can be found in content.css.</p>
          <p>We continually tested our website using a multitude of different browsers during development, in an effort to support as many as possible. Our website uses several HTML5-specific features (see <a href="#html" title="Go to HTML section">HTML</a>), along with several other features that aren't supported in older browsers, but we have attempted, where possible, to use the modernizr library to detect and substitute these for suitable replacements. One example of where modernizr is used is for SVG detection in the Send Funds section of the Wallet. Here an SVG of a camera (see <a href="#svg" title="Go to SVG section">SVG</a>) is used as a button icon; when modernizr detects a browser that cannot display SVG a fallback PNG image is used.</p>
          <p>When testing, we used <a href="browsershots.org" title="Go to BrowserShots">browsershots.org</a> to view our website as displayed by over 100 different browsers of varying ages on a variety of platforms. Additionally, we developed using Google Chrome, Chromium, Firefox and Internet Explorer to ensure that our website was as cross-platform complient as possible. The results of submitted our final site to BrowserShots was very positive, with almost all of the browsers displaying the website correctly.</p>
          <p>According to <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/browsers/browsers_stats.asp" title="Browser statistics">w3schools</a> over 50% of the web is browsed using recent versions of Chrome, with a further 25% using recent versions of Firefox. We support both of these browsers, including very old versions of them (we've tested back to version 10 for both, see below) along with Opera and a host of Linux-specific browsers, and are compatible with all of them. Some older browsers, such as IE6, and text-based browsers such as Lynx do not work as expected with maxwallet, however these represent a fractional amount of traffic on the web (around <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/browsers/browsers_explorer.asp" title="IE traffic by version">0.5% at worst</a>). To deal with this, we print an error message for older browsers using a CSS conditional comment.</p>
          <p>Some images of the home page running on a variety of early browsers, from BrowserShots, can be seen below.</p>

          <p>A final responsive element to our website is the dynamic resizing of YouTube videos. This was done in such a way that the aspect ratio of the video is maintained at 16:9, the ratio most videos use. This was achieved by wrapping the video <code>iframe</code> within a <code>div</code> and setting the padding to maintain the correct proportions using <code>padding-bottom: 56.25%;</code>. The About page features a YouTube video that uses this feature.</p>

          <!-- Search Engine Optimisation -->
          <h4><a id="seo" class="anchor">Search Engine Optimisation</a></h4>
          <p>Our website is being designed for real-world deployment and, as such, we have included features such as Search Engine Optimisation. The index page of the website contains meta tags with keywords, a description and the authors. The index page injects the content of other pages into itself, meaning it will be the most frequently crawled and thus the most important. When the back-end is implemented, meta tags for other pages can be modified using JavaScript. We have also submitted a <code>robots.txt</code> file; this is used by web-crawlers such as Googlebot to determine where to crawl and index pages, along with where not to go. The robots file also contains a link to our XML Sitemap. The Sitemap, <code>sitemap.xml</code>, describes the change-frequency and the index priority of the pages within the website, along with allowing isolated pages to be indexed. Both our robots file and the Sitemap conform to the relevant standards and could be submitted to most modern search engines as they are.</p>
          <p>Once the back-end of the website has been implemented, we will also include automatically-updating HTML "snapshots" of the dynamic content on the website, or that injected using JavaScript. This will allow these pages to be crawled by a traditional web-crawler and they will be added to the Sitemap when they are in place.</p>

          <!-- SVG -->
          <h4><a id="svg" class="anchor">SVG</a></h4>
          <p>We employed Inkscape to create 2 SVG graphics. One of these, a camera icon, was created for use as a button on the Send Funds section of the Wallet; the other, an outline of an envelope, was imported into GIMP and used an image on the Contact page.</p>
          <p>The camera icon was created solely within Inkscape. It was created by first making the lens using concentric circles, each with a small gap between it and the outer circle, varying the width of their strokes to create the effect of a zoomed camera lens. The centre of the lens was then given a radial blur and a highlight, using a low-opacity white layer that has been shaped using a Boolean difference operation. The rest of the camera was made using rectangles with a curved stroke, in varying shades. A line across the camera body was added for some interest and given a shadow, by duplicating it, moving it slightly down and right, then lowering the opacity. The same was done for the camera body itself to create some depth. Finally, a highlight was given to the camera viewport in the same way that the highlight to the lens was created.</p>
          <p>The envelope was a much simpler creation as it was to be modified within GIMP. The envelope was created by using the rectangle tool to create the basic shape, again with a rounded stroke to give it a softer appearence. The shadows and the top flap were then created by using the rulers to mark the edges of the envelope and using the straight line tool.</p>
