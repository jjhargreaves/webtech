        <h3><a id="abstract" class="anchor">Abstract</a></h3>
        <p>This report describes the submission of Luke Mitchell and Josh Hargreaves for the first assignment of the Web Technologies unit. Our submission is a web application that allows a user to create an online wallet that enables them to send and receive MaxCoin, a Bitcoin-like cryptocurrency that we developed earlier this year.</p>
        <p>Firstly, what is MaxCoin? MaxCoin is a cryptographic currency based upon the Bitcoin model. We created the currency to experiment with using algorithms with increased security that will enable us to utilise some very new technology, courtesy of Nigel Smart, and also to see what the effect of a media personality would have on the price of an altcoin. The coin was launched on the Keiser Report, a programme presented by Max Keiser, a proponent and namesake of the coin.</p>
        <p>This submission shows the framework and the front end of the web application. We have tried to include sample data to give a realistic impression of what the final experience will be like, when using the website. It is worth noting that, on occasion, the links on this submission will lead to a page that features unexpected content. Examples of this include the Address Book, where viewing any entry will always result in the entry for "Luke" being displayed, or where viewing any support ticket will result in the same ticket being displayed. The reason for this is that additional back-end development, including a database, is required for these features to function properly. We believe this is beyond the remit of this assignment and, for now, we've included example content as a placeholder.</p>

          <p>The application we have developed is called maxwallet. As explained in the abstract, the aim of maxwallet is to allow users to create a "web wallet", an online interface that allows them to access their MaxCoin and to send it to other users or merchants. The advantage of using a web wallet is threefold: users don't have to download a piece of software which, additionally, downloads the blockchain - the public ledger of all the transactions within MaxCoin; users can access their wallet from anywhere, worldwide, with an Internet connection; and, finally, it allows additional functionality to be included, such as the Standing Orders present within maxwallet, a feature that the desktop client doesn't have.</p>
          <p>Currently only a small handful of cryptocurrencies have web wallet services and it will be a great boon to MaxCoin once the service is launched. Additionally, we have taken great care to ensure the codebase is written in a modular manner so that it can be ported with ease to other currencies. Due to the financial nature of the web application, we have been vigilant to ensure that our code is as secure and well written as possible. If the service was to be hacked it would immediately lose it's credibility and become a detriment to the currency.</p>
          <p>Existing services for storing and handling cryptocurrency online include <a target="_blank" href="http://www.blockchain.info/">blockchain.info</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://secure.dogechain.info/wallet">dogechain.info</a>; these services typically allow a user to send and receive currency. With maxwallet, we will build upon this functionality by including the option to create regular payments to an address and to submit payment requests, much like a regular bank. We will also fully integrate with the upcoming MaxCoin Android wallet by allowing a user to interface with the web application using QR codes that we will both generate and read, using the client's camera.</p>

          <!-- Angular JS -->
          <h4><a id="angularjs" class="anchor">Angular JS</a></h4>
          <p>For this project we decided that we would use <a href="http://angularjs.org/" title="Go to the Angular JS website">Angular JS</a>. Angular is an open-source javascript
            MVC framework maintained by Google that assists in the making of single page applications. From doing research and experimenting with Angular, as well as other frameworks such as <a href="http://emberjs.com/" title="Go to the Ember JS website">Ember JS</a>, we concluded that Angular was the best fit in aiding us make a single page dynamic web application. Other frameworks deal with HTML's shortcomings by abastracting away HTML, CSS and/or javascript or by providing an imperitive way for manipulating the DOM. However none of these methods address the problem that HTML was simply not designed for dynamic views. Angular JS overcomes this by allowing you to extend the HTML vocabulary of your application. 
            <!--We could havemade such an application purely with JQuery and Ajax, however we saw real power in Angular's two way data-binding and templating that was just too great to ignore. We also felt that for the 'value added' part of this coursework we would prioritise adding functionality rather than reinventing the wheel.-->
          </p>
          <p>The first thing we looked to do with Angular was to enable navigation between pages without any reloads i.e. lay the foundations for a single page app. </p>

          <p>In Angular JS directives are markers on a DOM element (such as an attribute, element name, or CSS class) that tell Angular JS' HTML compiler to attach a specified behavior to that DOM element or transform the DOM element and its children. One of the directives that comes bundled with Angular is <code>ng-view</code>. When you set up the routing in angular with <code>ng-view</code>, you specify the HTML template Angular should load when asked for a particular URL. You typically add the <code>ng-view</code> attribute to an empty div which is to hold the main body of your content, and this is where Angular will inject the HTML template specified by your routing.</p>

          <p>We however found the <code>ng-view</code> directive to be a bit limiting as it is not possible to nest views within each other with it. However, we went away and researched possible solutions and ended up quickly coming accross a popular Angular module called <a href="https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-router" title="Go to angular-ui-router GitHub repository">ui-router</a>. <code>ui-router</code> gave us exactly what we were looking for; the ability to nest views with each other. <code>ui-router</code> works very similarly to Angular JS' router but it focuses purely on the state of the application. The routing is logically pretty similar to Angulars default router except now you're providing templates for particular states, and within the application you link to states rather than urls. However the thing we're intersted in is the abilty to construct a state hierachy, i.e. parent/child states aka nested states. In our application for example, this enables us to have a <code>wallet</code> state, and then have child states of <code>wallet</code> such as <code>send</code>, <code>recieve</code> etc.</p>

          <p>Once we had got our heads around the basic components of Angular JS and the <code>ui-router</code> specific directives for routing, we were left with everything we needed to create a basic 'one page application' with nested states. One thing we struggled with was making it so when you were in some child state of a state such as wallet (a state for when the wallet tab in the navbar was clicked), the wallet tab was still toggled as selected in the nav bar. We looked at how the <code>ui-router</code> sample application did this, however we found out that it too was using the same method as we but with no success. After much searching, we finally found the fix and also ended up submitting the fix as a pull-request the <code>ui-router</code> git repository.</p>

          <p>The next thing we set out to do was create a reusable Angular JS modal window directive. One of the idiums of Angular JS is that directives should be generic and reusable. A modal window in most cases can be said to have 3 components; the overlay behind the window, the window itself and the content. So ideally the directive that we construct for the modal window will always contain the same overlay and window but it'll just be the content inside the window that we change. Angular directives have a mind-boggling amount of options; one of them transclude. When transclude is set to true, and a template is provided within the directive, the content inside the element with the directive attribute, in this case our modal window directive attribute, is inserted into the element in the template with the <code>ng-transclude</code> attribute (only one of these is allowed in the template). This is exactly what we want. In our template we can put the overlay class and a window class, and specify with the <code>ng-transclude</code> attribute where we want our custom content to be inserted inside our template. To show and hide the modal window we can use the native angular directive <code>ng-show</code> which when assigned an expression which evaluates to true will hide itself and its children. If we have a variable such as <code>modalShown</code> which is initially set to false within our current scope, we can set a button to perform a function call which toggles the value of <code>modalShown</code> using the attribute <code>ng-click</code>. N.B that the difference between <code>on-click</code> and <code>ng-click</code> is that <code>ng-click</code> performs actions on the current scope.</p>

          <p>Controllers in Angular JS give us the really nice feature of encapsulation; anything in the HTML contained within an element with the attribute <code>ng-controller="someController"</code> will have access to its scope. Controllers are where you set up the intial state of the <code>$scope</code> object. In the case of the modal window, it's where we we set intially set <code>modalShown</code> equal to false. The element with the <code>ng-show</code> attribute will need to evaluate the <code>modalShown</code> value on the "someController" scope for everything to work correctly. This fundamentally means that it needs to be contained within an element with the attribute <code>ng-controller="someController"</code>.</p>

          <p>Now that we had created a modal window directive that we can populate with arbitrary content, it seemed logical for us to create a login form. The login form was to have an input field for both an email address and passsword. We decided to override the default HTML5 form validation error messages with our own as the HTML5  error messages didn't fit in that well theme wise with the rest of our site. Whenever you create a form within an angular application, it is actually an instance of an angular Controller <code>FormController</code>. Forms of instance FormController have their own scope which has a lot of useful properties on it. FormController lets you use attributes to specify whether a particular field is required, whether it has been left untouched, maximum and minimum valid length as well as a few other useful attributes that will set corresponding values on the scope indicating validity. This means that we can easily create nicely styled error messages by using <code>ng-show</code> to show and hide error messages based on what the user has entered. For example we could use <code>ng-show</code> in the following way to display to display unhide an element if the user has entered data in an input field and the data isn't valid where <code>userForm</code> is the name of the form and <code>password</code> is the name of the text field: <code>data-ng-show="userForm.password.$invalid &amp;&amp; !userForm.password.$pristine".</code> We also can check whether the entire form is valid using <code>userForm.$invalid</code>. Using this property we were able to disable the login button button of the login form until the user has entered a valid email and password. We have used similar form validation elsewhere in our application for other forms. Interestingly on the most up to date build version of angular, native number validation is broken, so we're likely going to have to implement the validation ourselves or even try and fix the native angular validation and submit a pull-request.</p>

          <p>
            When wanting to recieve some bitcoin/maxcoin you give someone an address to send the bitcoins to. It is useful sometimes to show someone a qrcode for them to scan. Additional paramters can be address to this address such as a label and amount. We thought we could demonstrate Angular's power by creating a qrcode that updated instantly when the user enters additional information such as a label or an amount. Angular works really well with existing javascript libraries. We created a directive to nicely wrap up the use of the library called <code>qrcodejs</code>. The nice thing bout using a directive for logic such as this, is that we don't have to query the DOM for the particular element we want to give to the <code>qrcode</code> library; the element is passed to us as a paramter inside the directive. Making the QRCode update when the user input changed prooved to be relatively straight-forward. We can bind the value contained in each input field to two values on the scope using the <code>ng-model</code> as an attribute on each input field element. We can use an angular function called <code>$watchCollection</code> to watch the values on the scope bound to the input fields. This function will fire everytime either of these values change. We can then update the QRCode element with the new information from within this function.
          </p>
          <p>
            Typically MVC apps make calls to the API for data which the app is going to display. For the most part in our application, we are not making that call to our API as it currently does not exist yet. But instead, we add some dummy data to the scope and use angular to dynamically template the HTML for us. In the case of our address book, our data will consist of a name and a coressponding payment address. We can use the angular <code>ng-repeat</code> in the following to template some html for us: <code>data-ng-repeat="data in tabledata"</code>. Whatever is inside the element that has this attribute will be repeated for every item in tabledata. Inside this element we can then use the curly bracket angular notation <code>{{data.name}}</code> to get the name of each item and put it in our table. For the server side of this project, the table data on the scope will be data returned by a call to our API. 
          </p>
          <p>As templated HTML is just a view of the data, in Angular when you change the data, the view of the data changes also. This means, that if we want to add data to the table, we just need to add items to the data model. This in Angular is fairly trivial to implement. We again bind the user input fields to the scope using <code>ng-model</code>. We then also create a function on the scope that when called pushes the values in the input fields into the json object holding data and then clear the variables bound to the text fields. When the server side is implemented, we will also have to send this information to the server for it to put in our database.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the overview tab of our wallet, we wanted it so that the current value in dollars of your coins is displayed. We created a Angular service that makes a cross site ajax call to a service hosting a json object with up to date price information. This service in true angular fashion can be injected as a dependency in any controller and its data accessed. Creating global services such as these is encoruaged over using global variables. We then parse the data and update a varible bound to a label in our <code>wallet.overview</code> so that the total value in dolars of the wallet's contents is displayed. Currently the total amount of coins is just a value on the scope so that it's really simple for us to update our application when we have an API.
          </p>
          <p>We decided to wait until the server was ready before we implemented a 'logged in'and 'logged out' state as there is a fair amount of functionality that needs to be added server side to properly implement such a thing. So for the time being we just wanted to display a nice looking toast when the login form say was submitted. For the toasts we used an angular module called 'toaster' which nicely wraps jquery toasts to give you a directived that can be reused over and over. We had to a make a few small modifications to this module to make the output of the XHTML compatable. However when we had sorted this and the dependency injection out we could add a function on the scope that could be called by any button to display a toast. For example, when the user pressed login on the login form, the modal window closes and a 'successful login' toast is displayed</p>

          <p>N.B. that normal URL based routing is still fully supported.</p>

          <!-- Responsive Design -->
          <h4><a id="responsivedesign" class="anchor">Responsive Design</a></h4>
          <p>The website we have created is fully responsive, working from all sizes of device from a widescreen, full HD screen (and larger) to a small mobile phone. The style sheets employed describe the widths as either percentages, for wrapping elements and containers, or ems, for anything related to text. Due to the use of a "sticky footer" and a "floating header", we have used pixel values in these areas; we have, however, used the <code>@media</code> CSS attributes to allow these to scale with the screen size.</p>
          <p>Certain components display completely differently when presented at different screen resolutions. One example of this is the navigation bar in the page header: this is normally a horizontal bar containing navigation items but, at screen resolutions below 768px, this is displayed as a single menu icon. When the menu icon is clicked it toggles a drop down menu containing the navigation links, conserving space on mobile devices. Another example is the tables within the Wallet section of the website: this section features a number of wallets containing information on transactions and addresses, each of which are stored in a tabular format. The tables are styled such that when they begin to overflow the surrounding element they contract and display a horizontal scroll bar instead.</p>
          <p>Below are some images showing the website being displayed at multiple resolutions.</p>

          <div class="spacer" />

          <p>On the home page of the website there is a "carousel", a series of 3 images than are animated and will cycle between themselves, each displaying a different message on a floating <code>div</code> element. The images displayed by the carousel are resized for a variety of common screen dimensions, from VGA to Full HD. These tailor the dimensions of the displayed image and also the source image to display; when a lower resolution is required a smaller image is served, reducing the amount of data required and saving the bandwidth of mobile users. There are 4 images of varying resolutions for this purpose. The styling for this can be found in content.css.</p>
          <p>We continually tested our website using a multitude of different browsers during development, in an effort to support as many as possible. Our website uses several HTML5-specific features (see <a href="#html" title="Go to HTML section">HTML</a>), along with several other features that aren't supported in older browsers, but we have attempted, where possible, to use the <a href="http://modernizr.com/" title="Go to the Modernizr website">Modernizr</a> library to detect and substitute these for suitable replacements. One example of where Modernizr is used is for SVG detection in the Send Funds section of the Wallet. Here an SVG of a camera (see <a href="#svg" title="Go to SVG section">SVG</a>) is used as a button icon; when Modernizr detects a browser that cannot display SVG a fallback PNG image is used.</p>
          <p>When testing, we used <a href="browsershots.org" title="Go to BrowserShots">browsershots.org</a> to view our website as displayed by over 100 different browsers of varying ages on a variety of platforms. Additionally, we developed using Google Chrome, Chromium, Firefox and Internet Explorer to ensure that our website was as cross-platform complient as possible. The results of submitted our final site to BrowserShots was very positive, with almost all of the browsers displaying the website correctly.</p>
          <p>According to <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/browsers/browsers_stats.asp" title="Browser statistics">w3schools</a> over 50% of the web is browsed using recent versions of Chrome, with a further 25% using recent versions of Firefox. We support both of these browsers, including very old versions of them (we've tested back to version 10 for both, see below) along with Opera and a host of Linux-specific browsers, and are compatible with all of them. Some older browsers, such as IE6, and text-based browsers such as Lynx do not work as expected with maxwallet, however these represent a fractional amount of traffic on the web (around <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/browsers/browsers_explorer.asp" title="IE traffic by version">0.5% at worst</a>). To deal with this, we print an error message for older browsers using a CSS conditional comment.</p>
          <p>Some images of the home page running on a variety of early browsers, from BrowserShots, can be seen below.</p>

          <p>A final responsive element to our website is the dynamic resizing of YouTube videos. This was done in such a way that the aspect ratio of the video is maintained at 16:9, the ratio most videos use. This was achieved by wrapping the video <code>iframe</code> within a <code>div</code> and setting the padding to maintain the correct proportions using <code>padding-bottom: 56.25%;</code>. The About page features a YouTube video that uses this feature.</p>

The index page injects the content of other pages into itself, meaning it will be the most frequently crawled and thus the most important. When the back-end is implemented, meta tags for other pages can be modified using JavaScript. We have also submitted a <code>robots.txt</code> file; this is used by web-crawlers such as Googlebot to determine where to crawl and index pages, along with where not to go. The robots file also contains a link to our XML Sitemap. The Sitemap, <code>sitemap.xml</code>, describes the change-frequency and the index priority of the pages within the website, along with allowing isolated pages to be indexed. Both our robots file and the Sitemap conform to the relevant standards and could be submitted to most modern search engines as they are.</p>
          <p>Once the back-end of the website has been implemented, we will also include automatically-updating HTML "snapshots" of the dynamic content on the website, or that injected using JavaScript. This will allow these pages to be crawled by a traditional web-crawler and they will be added to the Sitemap when they are in place.</p>

          <h4><a id="html" class="anchor">HTML</a></h4>
          <p>We opted to use HTML5 when writing maxwallet as it offers a range of useful features, such as the embedding of video, canvas elements and useful tag such as footer. We also felt that using the most up-to-date version was the most beneficial with regards to improving our skill set as web developers.</p>
          <p>The HTML5-specific tags that we utilise are the <code>footer</code> tags, allowing for cleaner, more readable code; the <code>svg</code> tag to embed vector graphics such as the camera icon (see <a href="#svg" title="Go to SVG">SVG</a>); and, finally, the <code>canvas</code> tags, for creating the QR code within the Receive Funds section of the Wallet.</p>
          <p>All the code used within the web application conform to HTML5 guidelines specified by the W3C and pass the W3C <a href="http://validator.w3.org/" title="Visit the W3C online validator">online validator</a>. A picture of the validation can be seen below.</p>

          <!-- CSS -->
          <h4><a id="css" class="anchor">CSS</a></h4>
          <p>Our web application uses valid CSS3, as verified by the W3C validator service. We opted to use CSS3 for similar reasons to using HTML5, as explained in the <a href="#html" title="Go to HTML section">previous section</a>, as it is the most recent standard and the one that offers the most functionality. We have used several CSS3-specific features such as the <code>nth-child</code> selector. Where possible we have also tried to include fallback styles, for older browser versions, to ensure that our website design is responsive and as cross-compatible as possible (see <a href="#responsivedesign" title="Go to Responsive Design section">Responsive Design</a> for more details).</p>
          <p>We have utilised the Twitter Bootstrap stylesheet as a base for our design, building upon the <a href="https://github.com/search?q=stars%3a%3E1&amp;s=stars&amp;type=Repositories" title="The most starred repositories on GitHub">most-starred</a> project on GitHub. Bootstrap has been used by a huge number of professional websites and provides CSS classes to allow the easy creation of a professional-looking, uniform website. We opted to use this framework as it allowed us to spend our time customising the look and feel of our website without having to re-invent the wheel; as such, we use many of the styling elements available within Bootstrap whilst still adding to these and skinning them in a unique manner.</p>
          <p>The design of maxwallet is a bespoke skin for Bootstrap, featuring new CSS classes, as well as overloading the existing ones provided by the framework. We have added a 2-tier "sticky footer", displaying some additional page navigation and social-media icons, as well as the copyright notice, to the bottom of the website. This footer sits at the bottom of the page regardless of it's height, and, additionally, will resize according to the screen dimensions, conforming to the responsive design principles of the website. We also implemented a custom, full-page width carousel using CSS3. The carousel uses some basic Bootstrap classes but we have rewritten multiple elements to ensure that this resizes responsively, along with allow the superposition of a text element and a full-width image to be used.</p>
          <p>Another place that we have extensively modified the framework is by creating responsive tables within the Wallet section of the website. This has been discussed previously but, for completeness' sake, we again mention that it uses valid CSS3 and that it improves upon the original framework.</p>
          <p>The colour scheme, layout and design of the website was our own design. We utilised an online colour-picking service to ensure a consistent collour scheme, and we took inspiration from many existing websites - although we have strived to ensure that maxwallet maintains a unique feel. All of the pages have been designed to utilise the same, responsive classes to ensure that the website maintains a consistent appearence throughout, regardless of the current page, or the platform used to view it.</p>

          <!-- SVG -->
          <h4><a id="svg" class="anchor">SVG</a></h4>
          <p>We employed Inkscape to create 2 SVG graphics. One of these, a camera icon, was created for use as a button on the Send Funds section of the Wallet; the other, an outline of an envelope, was imported into GIMP and used an image on the Contact page.</p>
          <p>The camera icon was created solely within Inkscape. It was created by first making the lens using concentric circles, each with a small gap between it and the outer circle, varying the width of their strokes to create the effect of a zoomed camera lens. The centre of the lens was then given a radial blur and a highlight, using a low-opacity white layer that has been shaped using a Boolean difference operation. The rest of the camera was made using rectangles with a curved stroke, in varying shades. A line across the camera body was added for some interest and given a shadow, by duplicating it, moving it slightly down and right, then lowering the opacity. The same was done for the camera lens to create some depth. Finally, a highlight was given to the camera viewport in the same way that the highlight to the lens was created.</p>
          <p>The envelope was a much simpler creation as it was to be modified within GIMP. The envelope was created by using the rectangle tool to create the basic shape, again with a rounded stroke to give it a softer appearence. The shadows and the top flap were then created by using the rulers to mark the edges of the envelope and using the straight line tool.</p>

          <!-- GIMP -->
          <h4><a id="gimp" class="anchor">GIMP</a></h4>
          <p>To demonstrate our ability to use GIMP, we created two images for the Contact section of the website. The first of these images, as described above, is a coloured envelope, to be displayed next to the business address as a postal icon. This was created by importing the SVG outline, colouring it and then cutting out the letter so that it sits within the envelope. The letter was cut out by using the Magic Wand tool to select the shadowed inside of the envelope, then, taking the inverse, and hiding the part of the letter within this selection. A highlight was then added by using a large, feathered brush set to a low opacity. The second of these images features Luke and Josh, framed within a circle each. This was created to add a personal element to the website. The image utilised a circular selection to cut out the faces from two photographs and placed on a transparent background. It was kept deliberately simple to be continuous with the professional, clean theme of the website.</p>
          <p>In the past Luke has done some work using Adobe Photoshop. We deliberately avoided using proprietary tools for this assignment and so avoided using Photoshop, instead using GIMP as a new tool for both Luke and Josh. An example of a previoius piece of work on Photoshop is the logo for <a href="http://www.quote-daily.com/" title="Go to Quote-Daily.com">quote-daily.com</a> which can be seen <a href="http://quote-daily.com/img/logo.png">here</a>. This is a previous project undertaken by Luke.</p>
          <p>A screenshot of the Contact page with the images made in GIMP can be seen below.</p>

          <p>When we distributed the work, we initially decided that Luke was to undertake the look and feel of the application, along with lots of the content, whereas Josh was to become familiar with Angular JS and work on the application framework. This stayed large true throughout the project, however, as we expected, we often turned our hands to help the other person. As such, we feel that we have both contributed evenly and fairly to this project and request that our marks be weighted identically as such.</p>

          <p>As we have utilised the Bower component for our project, we have included instructions for delpoying our application. This shouldn't be a problem for our submission, as we have included the dependencies will download, however, we have included the commands for completeness. The following instructions will work from a Unix terminal and can be easily adapted to work from a Windows Command Prompt if needed. A script, <code>install.sh</code>, has been included that performs these steps.</p>

            <code>$ cd maxwallet</code><br />
            <code>$ npm install</code><br />
